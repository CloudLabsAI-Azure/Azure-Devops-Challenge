# One Hackathon - Azure DevOps Challenge

Welcome to the Hack to Skill Azure DevOps Challenge.

In this hackathon, you will design, build, and validate a modern application delivery platform using Infrastructure as Code, multi-stage pipelines, and controlled progression mechanisms. The challenge progresses from a monolithic application to a microservices-based architecture while enforcing quality thresholds, staged execution, and operational visibility throughout the delivery lifecycle.

---

## Problem Statement

Modern engineering teams often struggle to standardize how infrastructure and application delivery pipelines are designed, secured, and governed. Many organizations still rely on manually created cloud resources, tightly coupled monolithic applications, and CI/CD pipelines that lack quality enforcement, traceability, and operational visibility.

Without structured controls, deployments become inconsistent, failures are difficult to trace, and governance mechanisms are often reactive rather than proactive. As systems evolve toward microservices architectures, the lack of standardized delivery practices creates operational complexity and risk.

This Hack to Skill challenge addresses these gaps. You will provision infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code, implement multi-stage CI pipelines with threshold-based progression, extend delivery principles to a microservices architecture, and introduce governance and traceability mechanisms to ensure operational readiness.

## About the Sandbox Environment

   | Resources | Value | Remarks |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Enabled Services | `Azure DevOps` <br> `Azure Virtual Machines` <br> `App Services` <br> `Azure Kubernetes Service` <br> `Container Apps`  | You will full access over Azure Subscription, utilize this to explore any desired Azure resources. |
   | Azure Entra ID User | Pre-created Entra ID user account | You will get one Entra ID User Account. |
   | Azure Subscription Permissions | **Owner** privilege over Azure Subscription | You will get Owner access to the Azure subscription. |
   | Azure Credit | **$110 USD**| Consumption limit is set on Azure spend to 110 USD. |
   | Credit Alerts | Credit Alerts are set on consumption of 25%, 50%, 75%, 85%, 90%, 95% and 100% of total Azure credits. |Make sure to check your registered email's inbox for any alert-related mails. Alerts give you a head start to keep your Azure spending in control and to plan out the remaining credits in the best way possible. |
   | Sandbox Duration | 5 Days/ 120 Hours or until Azure Consumption Credits are exhausted.  | The sandbox environment will be deleted automatically after 5 Days/120 Hours or once the Azure credits are exhausted, whichever comes first. |

## Best Practices:
+ **Resources usage:** Please stop the virtual machines, WebApps, Azure Kubernetes service, Azure Container Instance and other resources when not in use to minimize the Azure spend.
+ **Azure Cost Analysis:** Maintain a practice of regularly checking the Cost Analysis report for the assigned Azure subscription to ensure the sustainability of the environment over an extended period.
+ **Alert notifications:** Make sure to check your registered email's inbox for any alert-related emails. Alerts give you can head start to keep your Azure spending in control and to plan out the remaining credits in the best way possible.

## Hack to Skill Format: Challenge-Based

This hackathon is structured into four progressive challenges that model the lifecycle of modern DevOps implementation:

- **Challenge 1 - Platform Setup & Infrastructure Provisioning**  
  Onboard the monolithic application into Azure DevOps and provision required infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code.

- **Challenge 2 - CI Pipeline Implementation with Quality Thresholds (Monolithic Application)**  
  Design and implement a multi-stage CI pipeline with enforced validation criteria and controlled stage progression.

- **Challenge 3 - CI/CD Enablement for Microservices Application**  
  Extend delivery principles to a microservices-based application with independent service-level pipelines and deployment readiness validation.

- **Challenge 4 - Governance, Traceability & Operational Validation**  
  Integrate pipelines with Boards, enforce traceability, enable operational visibility, and validate end-to-end workflow readiness.

Each challenge builds upon the previous one, progressively strengthening the delivery platform from foundational infrastructure to enterprise-grade governance.
