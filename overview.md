# One Hackathon - Azure DevOps Challenge

Welcome to the Hack to Skill Azure DevOps Challenge.

In this hackathon, you will design, build, and validate a modern application delivery platform using Infrastructure as Code, multi-stage pipelines, and controlled progression mechanisms. The challenge progresses from a monolithic application to a microservices-based architecture while enforcing quality thresholds, staged execution, and operational visibility throughout the delivery lifecycle.

## Problem Statement

Modern engineering teams often struggle to standardize how infrastructure and application delivery pipelines are designed, secured, and governed. Many organizations still rely on manually created cloud resources, tightly coupled monolithic applications, and CI/CD pipelines that lack quality enforcement, traceability, and operational visibility.

Without structured controls, deployments become inconsistent, failures are difficult to trace, and governance mechanisms are often reactive rather than proactive. As systems evolve toward microservices architectures, the lack of standardized delivery practices creates operational complexity and risk.

This Hack to Skill challenge addresses these gaps. You will provision infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code, implement multi-stage CI pipelines with threshold-based progression, extend delivery principles to a microservices architecture, and introduce governance and traceability mechanisms to ensure operational readiness.

## Hack to Skill Format: Challenge-Based

This hackathon is structured into four progressive challenges that model the lifecycle of modern DevOps implementation:

- **Challenge 1 – Platform Setup & Infrastructure Provisioning**  
  Onboard the monolithic application into Azure DevOps and provision required infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code.

- **Challenge 2 – CI Pipeline Implementation with Quality Thresholds (Monolithic Application)**  
  Design and implement a multi-stage CI pipeline with enforced validation criteria and controlled stage progression.

- **Challenge 3 – CI/CD Enablement for Microservices Application**  
  Extend delivery principles to a microservices-based application with independent service-level pipelines and deployment readiness validation.

- **Challenge 4 – Governance, Traceability & Operational Validation**  
  Integrate pipelines with Boards, enforce traceability, enable operational visibility, and validate end-to-end workflow readiness.

Each challenge builds upon the previous one, progressively strengthening the delivery platform from foundational infrastructure to enterprise-grade governance.
